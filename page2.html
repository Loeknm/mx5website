        <h1>The Second Generation</h1>
        <p>The Mazda MX-5 NB is the bigger brother which entered the production line in 1998. It continued its predecessor's philosophy of being a lightweight 2 door coupe. Only with a more powerful engine and overall better performence inprovements, but some people might say it is not better than the first generation because of its "new" fixed headlights. </p>

        <h2>Great Value</h2>
        <p> The value of the NB model is rising, and it is probably the cheapest MX-5 model you can buy today. Lets look back at the MX-5 NA model, which a few years ago sold for around 1500 euro's in Europe. Now in 2023 you wont find a decent NA model for 4000 euro's, the ones in really great shape are selling for over 10000! Now, its only speculation, but the NB model is becoming older and older, and more populair, so i would say that this is the perfect time to get youself a nb. Its fun, reliably, and hopefully in the future it will become an icon just like the first generation. </p>

        <h2>Mazdaspeed</h2>
        <p>Since the release of the Miata in 1989, the Miata received numerous rewards throughout the years, it was named the first-ever "Car of the year" by <em>Automobile magazine</em>, so it seemed only natural to release a special edition of the car because of its succes. Resulting in the "Mazdaspeed edition". Equipped with a turbocharger making around 180HP to the rear wheels, enhanced suspenion by <em>Bilstein</em>, a six speed transmission, a complete <em>Bose audio system</em> and more. </p>
