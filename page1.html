        <h1>The First Generation</h1>

        <p>Its production ended in 1997, but due to its incredible attributes, this 1st gen MX-5, also known as the Miata, is a car that is loved to this day.</p>

        <p>The Miata was first made in 1989, which is a while ago. Now, car enthusiasts view the initial model as groundbreaking because it challenged the conventional concept of a sports car. Instead of relying on high-end technology, the manufacturer choose for a lower power output, high revving engine and an exceptionally light chassis, which was far from normal at the time. </p>

        <h2>Thrilling to drive</h2>
    
        <p>Because of its naturally aspirated 1.6-liter engine making 115 horsepower combined with only 950kg of weight, rear wheel drive with a manual transmission this car is very fun to drive. It is not particularly fast by any means, a 2020 Toyota Prius could probably outrun it, but there is something about the raw mechanical feeling paired with a screaming engine and sporty suspension that makes it a absolute blast to drive.   
        </p>

        <p>Another imported reason to why the MX-5 is a great drive are the options of modification. There is an easy accessible, endless after-market for these cars on a budget. Which results in people building the craziest Miata's. </p>

        <h2>Retractable headlamps</h2>
    
        <p>One of the most iconic aspects of this car is for sure its retractable headlights, also known as pop-up headlights. Many miata owners consider these lights a valuable feature of the ride as Mazda made it easy to control.
        Although people really liked the pop-up headlights, it was being considered too dangerous as it caused a hazard for pedestrians. So the NA is the last of its kind to have the old retro look, which makes the car extra valuable.</p>

        <h2> Reliability </h2>
        <p>Anyone who has ever bought a car knows that one of the most important aspects is reliability. You just want a car that either lasts long or is easy to fix. Now the miata occasionally has its problems, but it is well known to be one of the most reliable vehicles of its time. The car typically has a longer lifespan that its competitors. According to <a href="https://repairpal.com"> Repair Pal</a>, the Miata has a 4 out if 5 rating in reliability. And on top of that, almost half a million of the first generation MX-5 were made, making it easy and cheap to find parts when it does break down.</p>
